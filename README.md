# Crop-recommendation-by-Season
Agriculture plays a crucial role in country's economy and choosing the right crop for the right season is essential for maximising yield and ensuring sustainable farming. It uses ML techniques to help farmers and agricultural planners make informed decisions about which crop to cultivate in a given season based on environmental and soil parameters.

# Overview
The **Crop Recommendation by Season** system is a **Machine Learning project** that recommends the most suitable crop to grow based on input parameters such as **temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil type, and season**.  
This project helps farmers make **data-driven decisions**, improving productivity and reducing risk by aligning crop choices with seasonal conditions.

# Objective
To develop an ML model that analyzes environmental and seasonal data to **predict the most appropriate crop** for a given season.
